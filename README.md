# SummerPlanner
GUI Application made in Python using tkinter package.
Made for my personal use. I had trouble keeping track of deadlines and important dates relating to schoolwork. To better accustom myself to Python, better organize future assignments and to keep myself occupied.

## Running Program
Requires Python to run. Run "main.pyw" to open the program. Do not touch "test.pickle", editing it will probably mess with the program because it cannot read the data format. If it does happen, delete everything in "test.pickle". This is if you cannot redo your past edit.
